    <p>"Throughout our company's history, the Dragon models may be the most visually striking instruments we've ever created. From ornate inlays featuring abalone, gold, and pearl, to our most highly figured woods, every limited edition Dragon is a union of art and musical instrument. This year we're excited to offer another iteration of this celebrated collection, and because it's an anniversary year, we thought it would be fun to look back at all nine PRS Dragon instruments, from 1992's Dragon I to this year's 35th Anniversary Dragon." - PRS Guitars</p>
